### Stephen Curry's 3 Point Shot Trend
Stephen Curry is known for being one of the greatest 3-point shooters in the NBA. This graph shows his success rates of his 3-point shots, starting from his rookie year in 2009 to today after winning two championships and two MVP awards. There is a huge decrease in 2011 in 3-points attempted because Curry had an ankle injury that left him to appear in only 26 games that season.
